hook into network strings and rcc strings

find how ulx applies ban time restrictions and the like on my PK server

ok: an example would be
ulx userallow "Shinycow" "ulx ban" "* 1:18h <aaa,faa>"

seperate by spaces for args

so in example "*" == first arg, can ban everyone
1:18h == second arg, minimum 1 minute, max 18 hours
<aaa,faa> == third arg, <> == strings allowed, so ban reasons can be either aaa or faa

another example

ulx userallow "Shinycow" "ulx banid" "<STEAM_0:0:29257121,STEAM_0:0:12345> :45m <noob,gay>"

<STEAM_0:0:29257121,STEAM_0:0:12345> == first arg, only can banthese people
:45m == second arg, no minimum ban time, max is 45 minutes
<noob,gay> == third arg, ban reasons allowed.
